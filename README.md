# Syntax-Analyser
Automated system that assists in the study of code and gives a brief overview of the variables used, in-built functions used, whether proper syntax is followed in a particular source code file

## Introduction

- The program is run by the administrator who can pass any C program file to the program according to the need. 
- The Program Analyser Project in C utilizes data structure to store the data and to traverse between the C file to check each character, used for checking multiple conditions throughout the program. 
- This study aimed to help a programmer to have an efficient and effective way of monitoring their code to give a higher quality of service. 

## Software Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 or above
- Programming language: C 
- Code  editor: VS code

## Approach

- In this project, the main program automatically reads all the data present in the code on which the report is to be generated. 
- The data is stored character-wise and then it goes through multiple condition statements which determine the functions and variables used and as an output displays all the data in a presentable manner. 
- Data structures have been used effectively to handle co-related functions and to store and traverse through the recoded information. 
- We have used the different functions for performing different reading and storing operations in this project.

file_reading() : To Read A-C File And Store All The Data

void chk() : To Put The Stored Data Through Multiple Conditional Statements To Generate Information For Final Output.
